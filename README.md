Made for my step by step tutorial on: [http://www.lostiemposcambian.com](http://www.lostiemposcambian.com)


##Starting Point

Includes a .ZIP starting point with the files needed to begin working with the screencast with no hassle. Ember and Handlebars versions are from the Ember Starter Kit (not the latest), Ember Data is Revision 12.

##Screencast

##Step by Step

You can follow an step by step recreation of the screencast on http://www.lostiemposcambian.com/blog/javascript/tutorial-de-ember-screencast-paso-a-paso/ (in spanish).

The step by step goes up to the point where we move away from the ```FixturesAdapter``` and start using a server REST service, which is not implemented.
